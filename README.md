## Machine Learning for Bussiness Leaders

What are the made assumptions?
What is your learning target? (Hypothesis)
What type of ML problem is it?
Why did you choose this algorithm?
How eill you evaluete the model performance?
How confident are you that you can generalize the results?

## Machine Learning Scope:
What is the specific business problem?
What is the current state?
What are the current pain points?
What is the problems impact?
What is the problems impact?
Hou would the solution be used?
What is out of scope?
How do you define sucess?

### Input Gathering:
Do we have sufficient data?
Is there labeled examples?
If not, how difficult would it be to create/obtain?
What are our features?
What are going to be the most useful inputs?
Where is the data?
What is the data quality?

### Output Definitions:
What business metric is defining success?
What are the trade-offs?
Are there existing baselines?
If not, what is the simplest solutions?
Is there any data validation needed to greenlight the project?
How important is runtime and performance?
