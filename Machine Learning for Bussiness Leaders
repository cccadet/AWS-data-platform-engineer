## Machine Learning for Bussiness Leaders

What are the made assumptions?
What is your learning target? (Hypothesis)
What type of ML problem is it?
Why did you choose this algorithm?
How eill you evaluete the model performance?
How confident are you that you can generalize the results?

## Machine Learning Scope:
What is the specific business problem?
What is the current state?
What are the current pain points?
What is the problems impact?
What is the problems impact?
Hou would the solution be used?
What is out of scope?
How do you define sucess?

### Input Gathering:
Do we have sufficient data?
Is there labeled examples?
If not, how difficult would it be to create/obtain?
What are our features?
What are going to be the most useful inputs?
Where is the data?
What is the data quality?

### Output Definitions:
What business metric is defining success?
What are the trade-offs?
Are there existing baselines?
If not, what is the simplest solutions?
Is there any data validation needed to greenlight the project?
How important is runtime and performance?

## When should you consider using machine learning to solve a problem?
1 Use Machine Learning when software logic is too difficult to code
2 Use Machine Learning when the manual process is not cost effective
3 Use Machine Learning when there is ample training data
4 Use Machine Learning when the problem is formalizable as an ML Problem

## When is Machine Learning NOT a Good Solution?
1 No data
2 No labels
3 Need to launch quickly
4 No tolerance for mistakes

## Supervied Learning
Labeled data
### Classification (Spam or not-Spam)
* Binary Classifications
* Multi-Class Classifications
### Regression (Price of ...)
* Estimation

## Unsupervised Learning
No label
### Clustering


## Reinforcement Learning
